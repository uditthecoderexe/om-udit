There are many types of headphones to choose from: in-ears, on-ears, over-ears, wired, wireless or true wireless, Bluetooth or noise-cancelling or both. So which style should you invest in?

If you want a pair for home use, to plug into your hi-fi system or portable music player, then a pair of wired over-ear headphones is best. You'll then have to choose whether you want an open-back design (which leaks sound) or the more typical closed-back style (which don't).

To use with your smartphone on the go, though, you might want something more portable. And if that's the case, you'll have to decide whether you want the uber-portability of in-ear earbuds or the less intrusive fit of on-ear headphones – and both styles vary in terms of budget and features.



Your next decision is between wired and wireless. Wireless headphones and wireless earbuds are great for their cable-free convenience, but it's a technology that generally attracts a higher price tag compared to wired counterparts of similar sonic quality.

Then there are noise-cancelling headphones, which may be high on your hit list if you're looking for a pair to silence the outside sounds of everyday life. Noise-cancelling helps isolate you from the world by blocking ambient noise, and these days it's becoming more and more popular on premium wireless pairs.

And lastly, if you're a fitness fiend who wants to prioritise portability, secure fit and waterproofing? You'll probably better off going for a sport-savvy pair of sport headphones.

If you're still not sure which way to go, then take a look at our guide on how to choose the right pair of headphones. You might then want to delve into one of our specific buying guides, or perhaps take a glance at our very favourite pairs across all styles, feature offerings and price points. 

above is a round-up of the best-quality headphones on the market right now, so you've got the best chance of finding the right pair for you...</div>
